# The Application of Multivariate Analysis Methods in Assessing Air Pollution Levels  

## Overview  

This project explores the application of multivariate analysis methods to assess air pollution levels. It utilizes various statistical techniques, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Factor Analysis, and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), to analyze air quality data and identify patterns, sources, and relationships among different pollutants.
